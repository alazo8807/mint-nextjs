This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## Setting Up the Database on a New Device

Follow these steps to set up the database when working on a new device:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Ensure the `.env` file exists in the root of your project with the correct `DATABASE_URL`. For SQLite, it should look like this:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```
NOTE: prisma doesn't seem to be able to read .env.local, so make sure the `DATABASE_URL` is set up in .env

If you are using a different database file (e.g., prod.db, sandbox.db), update the `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.


### 3. Run Migrations
Apply the existing migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This command ensures the database structure matches the schema defined in the project.


### 4. Generate the Prisma Client
Regenerate the Prisma Client to ensure it matches the current schema:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```


### 5. Verify the Database (Optional)
To verify the database setup, you can use Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This opens a web interface where you can view and edit the database data.


Your database is now set up and ready to use!

## Adding a migration

### 1. Make Changes to the Schema
Edit the schema.prisma file in your project directory to reflect the changes you want to make in your database structure. For example:

```
model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name  String
  email String  @unique
  age   Int?    // Adding a new optional field
}
```
### 2. Run the Migration Command
Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Then, run: 
```
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>
```
NOTE: prisma doesn't seem to be able to read .env.local, so make sure the `DATABASE_URL` is set up in .env
If you are using a different database file (e.g., prod.db, sandbox.db), update the `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.

### 3. Review the Generated SQL
Prisma will generate a migration file in the prisma/migrations directory. It contains SQL instructions for applying your changes. Review it to ensure it aligns with your expectations.

### 4. Apply the Migration
Prisma will automatically apply the migration to your development database. If it doesnâ€™t, you can apply it manually:
```
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 5. Check the Database
Use Prisma Studio to inspect the updated database:
`npx prisma studio`
.Alternatively, query your database directly using a database client.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
